Hi, I'm Jenagan Sivakumar. I'm a  full-stack web developer who's passionate about building user-friendly and interactive web applications.

I specialise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, MongoDB, and APIs. I have worked on several projects that allowed me to apply my skills and learn new things.

If you're looking for a talented and motivated full-stack web developer, I'd love to hear from you.
