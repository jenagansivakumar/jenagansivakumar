Hi, I'm Jenagan Sivakumar. I'm a new full-stack web developer who recently graduated from Spiced Academy. I'm passionate about building user-friendly and interactive web applications.

In my course, I learned the fundamentals of front-end and back-end development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, MongoDB, and APIs. I also worked on several projects that allowed me to apply my skills and learn new things.

I'm eager to learn more and to start building real-world applications. I'm also a team player and I'm always willing to help others.

If you're looking for a talented and motivated full-stack web developer, I'd love to hear from you.
